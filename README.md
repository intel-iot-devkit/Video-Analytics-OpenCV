# Video Analytics Code Samples using OpenCV

This repository contains Python\* code samples which us the Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV) Library.  These code samples are a good starting point for developers, across a wide range of markets, who wish to develop more robust computer vision and analytic solutions. 

The code samples are mainly in two categories: Diagnostics and Application

Diagnostic Samples:

	Sample 01 - Version information and environment variables
	Sample 02 - OpenCV build information
	Sample 03 - Basic image test - overlay text
	Sample 04 - Basic video test - stream and overlay text
	Sample 05 - Checks for OpenCL™ availability
	Sample 07 - Checks for hardware extension support

Application Samples:

	Sample 06 - Video steam and capture image
	Sample 08 - Watermarking still image
	Sample 09 - Watermarking display stream
	Sample 10 - Still image face and eye detection
	Sample 11 - Real-time video face detection and tracking
	Sample 12 - Real-time people counter

The twelve computer vision code samples in this repository have been optimized using Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel® IPP) and the Intel® Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL). By following these code samples with the optimized libraries, you will be able to see performance improvements over the basic installation of OpenCV.
